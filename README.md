üöÄ NexusCore Dashboard

NexusCore is a modern, web-based control panel for managing your Space Engineers dedicated servers. It uses Docker to keep your servers organized and running smoothly, all through a clean and simple interface.

(It's highly recommended to replace this with a GIF of your dashboard in action!)
